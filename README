The purpose of these files are to show some of the methods I have used for past employers.

The test's objective is to go to airline websites, assert elements appear as expected and that
workflows execute as intended.

Of course, there are issues where big corporations include certain protections that make automating
a little difficult, primarily when they ask if I am a robot in the middle of the test.

These files, test scenarios, syntax of locators and functions, etc., do not represent a rigid way of thinking
or working. The opposite, because I had to how to set up the test enviornment (unittest vs pytest), classes, inheriting
functions between different folders and classes, and a lot of debbuging and searching online for answers.

I am well experience in automation testing, but that does not mean I am not flexible in learning
or in my methodolgy in working. I come with experience and plenty of room to learn how different
organizations work, create, and communicate, so I can avoid being a stagnat asset thats only good
at what I am hired for and resistant against change. Instead I aim to be a growing asset, one that
learns the ropes of team, isn't scared to learn new technologies (Eggplant, Cucumber, etc), and am
more than willing to pick up roles outside of my job description to help the team when help is needed.
